Building the OTRS package
=========================

1. Use opm.pl to create the package, thus:

[otrs home]/bin/opm.pl -a build -p /path/to/OpenNMS.sopm -d /path/to/

for me, with otrs in /Users/user/Documents/otrs/otrs and the otrs-opennms code checked out to /Users/user/svn/otrs-opennms:

jsartin-mac:~ user$ /Users/user/Documents/otrs/otrs/bin/opm.pl -a build -p /Users/user/svn/otrs-opennms/otrs/OpenNMS.sopm -d /Users/user/svn/otrs-opennms/otrs/
Writing /tmp/OpenNMS-0.1.0.opm
jsartin-mac:~ user$


Add the package to otrs
=======================

1. At the webUI for OTRS, go to Admin->Package Manager.
2. Add the package (/tmp/otrs-opennms-0.1.0.opm).
3. Hit "continue" at the dire warning page.

Add the SOAP user to OTRS
=========================

1. At the webUI for OTRS, go to Admin->SysConfig.
2. Show the Group for "Framework".
3. Select Core::SOAP
4. Set the SOAP::User and SOAP::Password (the sample java code expects opennms/opennms). The opennms package uses the same authentication technique as the existing SOAP handle.

Check that you have the required Perl Modules installed
=======================================================

Ensure you have the SOAP::Lite, and SOAP::DateTime CPAN modules installed. If you have used the existing OTRS SOAP handle, you will probably already have SOAP::Lite.

Compile the Java and run the tests
==================================

You'll need maven for this. At the root of the otrs-opennms package that you downloaded from the OpenNMS repo, run:

jsartin-mac:~/Documents/otrs/otrs-opennms user$ mvn test

This will compile the code and run the tests (there are 7 of them). The tests expect to see your OTRS server at http://localhost/otrs/. You should now see some tickets in your otrs raw queue.

Hope that this has been of some use to you.
